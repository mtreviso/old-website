<p>I am a 1st year Ph.D Student in Natural Language Processing at the University of São Paulo, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=9mDOHngAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR">Prof. Sandra M. Aluísio</a>. My current research is focused on Automatic Speech Recognition for impaired speech, a very noise and spontaneous kind of speech recorded in a clinical environment. I am also a member of <a href="http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/">NILC</a> -- The Interinstitutional Center for Computational Linguistics, one of the most relevant NLP groups in Brazil.

I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at the University of São Paulo, also under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=9mDOHngAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR">Prof. Sandra M. Aluísio</a>. My dissertation included two topics well known to enrich speech transcripts: sentence segmentation and disfluency removal. I worked with methods mostly based on deep learning architectures (e.g. recurrent convolutional neural network) using text representations (word embeddings) and audio representations (such as pitch, energy and pause). As part of my research, I built an annotated corpora with end of sentence punctuation and different types of disfluency marks; and I developed a free and open-source tool called <a href="https://github.com/mtreviso/deepbondd/">DeepBondd</a>. During this period, I published one paper in an international NLP conference, and three in national conferences -- including the 2nd best paper award granted by the Brazilian Society for Computing.

I took my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Pampa. I started to learn about ML and NLP and developed a part-of-speech tagger for my final paper, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H2TZPvYAAAAJ&hl=en">Fabio N. Kepler</a>. During this period, I carefully studied the book Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), solving several exercises and making some of them available in my <a href="http://mtreviso.wordpress.com/">personal blog</a>. I was also enrolled in programming marathons and achieved 3rd place in the regional phase of 2015 with a team of undergrad colleagues. Before the undergrad, I worked for 2 years developing web applications for <a href="http://macropublicidade.com.br/">Macro Publicidade</a>, a very enjoyable period of my life that made me passionate about computer programming.
