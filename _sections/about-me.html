<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="assets/images/about.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>I am a 2nd year Ph.D student within DeepSPIN, an ERC-funded research project coordinated by <a href="https://andre-martins.github.io/">Prof. André Martins</a> at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">IST / University of Lisbon</a>. I've been working with Quality Estimation (as part of the OpenKiwi project and by participating in the WMT2019 shared task), Explainability and Continuous Attention projects.

<!-- <p>Recently, I worked for three months as a Research AI Intern at <a href="https://unbabel.com/">Unbabel</a>. During this period I contributed in <a href="https://github.com/Unbabel/OpenKiwi">OpenKiwi</a>, an open-source project of quality estimation of machine translation by implementing state-of-the-art deep learning methods using PyTorch.

<p>I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/">University of São Paulo (USP)</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=9mDOHngAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR">Prof. Sandra M. Aluísio</a>. As part of my research, I developed a free and open-source tool called <a href="https://github.com/mtreviso/deepbondd/">DeepBondd</a>. In addition, I received the best Master's dissertation award from 2015 to 2018 granted by the Brazilian Society for Computing at <a href="http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/propor-2018/best-dissertations-awards/">PROPOR 2018</a>.</p>

<p>I took my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidade_Federal_do_Pampa">Federal University of Pampa</a>. I started to learn about ML and NLP for my final paper, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H2TZPvYAAAAJ&hl=en">Fabio N. Kepler</a>. As a result, I developed a <a href="https://github.com/mtreviso/deeptagger/">part-of-speech tagger</a> based on deep neural networks.</p> -->

<p>In 2018 I was enrolled in a Ph.D position in Natural Language Processing at the University of São Paulo, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=9mDOHngAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR">Prof. Sandra M. Aluísio</a>. My interrupted research was focused on Automatic Speech Recognition for impaired speech, a very noise and spontaneous kind of speech recorded in a clinical environment. The research was conducted within <a href="http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/">NILC</a> -- The Interinstitutional Center for Computational Linguistics, one of the most relevant NLP groups in Brazil.

I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at the University of São Paulo, also under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=9mDOHngAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR">Prof. Sandra M. Aluísio</a>. My dissertation included two topics well known to enrich speech transcripts: sentence segmentation and disfluency removal. I worked with methods mostly based on deep learning architectures (e.g. recurrent convolutional neural network) using text representations (word embeddings) and audio representations (such as pitch, energy and pause). As part of my research, I built an annotated corpora with end of sentence punctuation and different types of disfluency marks; and I developed a free and open-source tool called <a href="https://github.com/mtreviso/deepbondd/">DeepBondd</a>. During this period, I published one paper in an international NLP conference, and three in national conferences -- including the best Master's dissertation award from 2015 to 2018  granted by the Brazilian Society for Computing at <a href="http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/propor-2018/best-dissertations-awards/">PROPOR 2018</a>.

I took my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Pampa. I started to learn about ML and NLP and developed a <a href="https://github.com/mtreviso/deeptagger/">part-of-speech tagger</a> for my final paper, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H2TZPvYAAAAJ&hl=en">Fabio N. Kepler</a>. During this period, I carefully studied the book Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), solving several exercises and making some of them available in my <a href="http://mtreviso.wordpress.com/">personal blog</a>. Before the undergrad, I worked for 3 years designing/developing web applications for <a href="http://macropublicidade.com.br/">Macro Publicidade</a>, a very enjoyable period of my life that made me passionate about computer programming.
